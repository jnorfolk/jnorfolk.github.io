## Professional Summary
Prior to my time over the last 1.5 years developing my data science skills independently and then through TripleTen's program, I worked on a number of fascinating physics projects in my physics B.S. - namely, planning out scientific data collection for a NASA sounding rocket as part of a PSU engineering group and evaluating X-ray detectors' comparative effectiveness with Python at Lawrence-Livermore National Lab, plus documenting the assembly of a key experiment part for dark matter project LUX-LZ. 

Now, I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and statistical analysis. Leveraging 1+ year of experience in data-driven projects and a B.S. in Physics; excelling in transforming complex ideas into actionable strategies. Known for quick learning, effective mentorship, and fostering collaborative team environments. 

Alongside my physics experience, I have thoroughly enjoyed teaching children, working first as a camp counselor and then as a science teacher for Nature's Classroom. I developed physics-based curriculums and improved my ability to communicate physics and experimental principles to a less knowledgeable audience, while exhibiting patience and empathy.

Personally speaking: for years I have loved rock climbing and hiking. I devoted a year, sometime between my college graduation and the start of my data science program, to traveling the United States in my car by myself and climbing in the desert and mountains as much as possible. Beyond finding that the world is a beautiful place, I honed my sense of technical and emotional problem-solving in terms of rope systems, trip logistics, and teamwork with strangers. If asked when I've had to "think on my feet," certainly there have been instances in professional settings where this was required of me - but nothing comes to mind more sharply than the numerous times that I took the lead to problem-solve myself and my partners out of unexpected and pressing trouble.
