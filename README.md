## Professional Summary
Prior to my time over the last 1.5 years developing my data science skills independently and then through TripleTen's program, I worked on a number of fascinating physics projects in my physics B.S. - namely, planning out scientific data collection for a NASA sounding rocket as part of a PSU engineering group and evaluating X-ray detectors' comparative effectiveness with Python at Lawrence-Livermore National Lab, plus documenting the assembly of a key experiment part for dark matter project LUX-LZ. 

Now, I am a Data Scientist/Analyst with a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and statistical analysis. Leveraging 1+ year of experience in data-driven projects and a B.S. in Physics; excelling in transforming complex ideas into actionable strategies. Known for quick learning, effective mentorship, and fostering collaborative team environments. 

Alongside my physics experience, I have thoroughly enjoyed teaching children, working first as a camp counselor and then as a science teacher for Nature's Classroom. I developed physics-based curriculums and improved my ability to communicate physics and experimental principles to a less knowledgeable audience, while exhibiting patience and empathy. I currently work a few hours per week as a climbing instructor.

As of late spring 2024, I have accumulated several data experiences that have further bolstered my confidence. I worked on an extremely challenging externship with Dataspeak (small tech consulting), where I built a chatbot (like ChatGPT) to answer user questions specifically based on proprietary data, presenting my solution to the CEO. I then worked on an externship with Besample (small worldwide survey conduction), where I found features that were most important to classifying a user as a bot through reverse-engineered machine learning model outputs, and informed the Besample team on how to use the technique for themselves. Currently, I work with Data Annotation as a freelancer, sharpening my coding skills by conducting reviews of AI (like ChatGPT) outputs, creating science/math-based prompt sets for AI to learn from, and essentially performing a wide variety of tasks contributing to AI development.

Personally speaking: for years I have loved rock climbing and hiking. I devoted a year, sometime between my college graduation and the start of my data science program, to traveling the United States in my car by myself and climbing in the desert and mountains as much as possible. Beyond finding that the world is a beautiful place, I honed my sense of technical and emotional problem-solving in terms of rope systems, trip logistics, and teamwork with strangers. If asked when I've had to "think on my feet," certainly there have been instances in professional settings where this was required of me - but nothing comes to mind more sharply than the numerous times that I took the lead to problem-solve myself and my partners out of unexpected and pressing trouble.

## Experience

### Data Annotator/Code Reviewer | Data Annotation (04/2024 - Present)
- Facilitate the training of AI chatbots, contributing to the advancement of sophisticated AI programs through iterative learning processes and algorithm refinement.
- Engage in fact-based research and craft inventive prompts aimed at challenging the LLM (Large Language Model) to produce responses that prioritize safety and ethical considerations.
- Strengthen the understanding of LLMs via review, editing, and evaluation of Python code output, and by creating sample prompt/answer sets.
- Address instances of hallucinations, unsafe responses, verbosity, and adherence to instructions through rigorous monitoring of LLM outputs.

### Data Scientist/Analyst | Besample (04/2024-06/2024)
- Uncovered important aspects of bot behavior for Besample, a very small company that collects worldwide data from paid surveys (bots scam Besample out of money and introduce unreliable data).
- Reverse-engineered trained machine learning models to find the most significant features of bot behavior, using an established list of bots.
- Educated Besample staff on how to use this technique to supplement their future analyses during the final presentation.
